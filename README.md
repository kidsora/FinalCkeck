✍️ Thoughts and Reflections
This Bootcamp wasn’t just a tech experience — it was a life shift for me. I came into it after going through mental, financial, and emotional challenges. I used to doubt myself, feel lost, and unsure about my future. But now, I have clarity, a skill I can grow with, and a dream that’s becoming more real day by day.

This isn’t the end — it’s the beginning.
I still want to improve:

Become stronger in backend and testing

Combine my tech skills with entrepreneurship

Keep growing spiritually, mentally, and professionally
